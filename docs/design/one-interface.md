# /one — the AI-conducted home (spark `one-interface`, round 1)

`/one` is a signed-in alternative home for the recruiter: ONE surface, conducted from a
conversation, that puts views from every module (pipeline, decisions, schedule, jobs,
analytics, comms) in one sight. Today's Workspace (`/` with `?tab=`) stays exactly where it
is and is reached from `/one` as the **Console** (top-right link, or Ctrl/⌘ K →
`/?tab=pipeline`).

Round 1 ships one shared **core** and three **layout directions** on it — Greet, Stage,
Brief — chosen with `?v=greet|stage|brief` (unknown or absent → greet). The round judges
shape and visual register; the core is the part that must already be complete and honest.

Governing standard: registry subject `model-composed-workspace` (golden path +
`composition-region`, `reversible-screen-ops`). Shape reference (not code):
`paypal/docs/design/conversational-home*.md`.

## Entry points

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `app/one/page.tsx` | Server page. Not public (absent from `app/_lib/auth/public-routes.ts`); repeats the home gate (`hasEnteredWorkspace`, else redirect to `/`). Reads `?v=` server-side. `instant = false` (cookies + searchParams per request). The layout switcher shows only outside production builds. |
| `app/features/one/OneShell.tsx` | Owns the core and the fixed chrome (Console link, Ctrl/⌘ K, switcher); hands the selected variant `VariantProps`. Wrapped in `KitSurface` (calm density) so kit tips and tokens work in every variant. |
| `app/features/one/variants/index.ts` | `VARIANTS: Record<VariantId, ComponentType<VariantProps>>`, each `next/dynamic`-loaded from `variants/<id>/<Id>Variant.tsx`. A builder replaces only its own file. |
| `app/features/one/variants/PlaceholderLayout.tsx` | The plain reference wiring every variant starts from: greeting, turns, chips, composer (Send / Stop), change line + Undo, region of views, consent cards. |

## The contract (`app/features/one/types.ts`)

Closed vocabularies in the repo's shape (literal array + derived union + runtime guard):
`PANEL_KINDS` (needs, pipelineSlice, scheduleAhead, funnel, jobDrafts, outbox,
decisionsQueue, roleCard), `ACT_KINDS` (entryAdvance, entryReject, wave, companion),
`CHIP_IDS`, `SAY_KEYS`, `CHANGE_KEYS`, `VARIANT_IDS`.

- `Op` = `show` (a panel, params) · `focus` (a panel on screen) · `propose` (an act, params)
  · `navigate` (a Console tab, params). There is no verb that moves, hides or resizes chrome.
- `Reply` = `{ say: { key, values? }, ops ≤ 4, chips ≤ 4, fallback? }`. `say` is a catalog key
  under `one.core.say.*`, never English, and carries **no figure**.
- `VariantProps` (`variantProps.ts`): `variant`, `session` (state + hand actions), `submit`,
  `greeting`, `attention`, `renderPanel(panel, {look, className})`,
  `renderConsent(proposal, {className})`, `words`, `consoleHref`.

## The turn

1. **Greeting** (`engine/greeting.ts`) — composed by the host from `GET /api/attention`:
   a status line, the FIRST need by priority (decisions > pipeline aging > channels/new
   arrivals > schedule > job drafts) and ≤ 4 chips. Nothing waiting → "all clear". A failed
   read → "could not read", never "all clear". Its counts are fetched data, which is why
   the greeting may carry a number and a `Reply` may not.
2. **Resolve** (`engine/resolve.ts`) — pure and deterministic. A chip is its intent; typed
   words go through an ordered keyword matcher (the specific before the general: "reject
   below", "draft a JD" before "drafts"). Intents: needs, decisions, pipeline (optionally
   "for <role>"), stalled, interviews, funnel, new arrivals, drafts, outbox, role, reject
   below N% [on role], advance top N, the four companion acts, console. Anything else →
   `notYet` + three chips, never a guess. The user's own words (a role, a threshold) travel
   as op **params**.
3. **Validate** (`engine/validate.ts`) — the one door every reply passes, even the
   deterministic one: unknown verbs/panels/acts/chips/tabs are dropped and **counted** (the
   turn discloses "N parts could not be shown"); > 4 ops are cut; a `propose` with any
   undeclared field is dropped whole; an entry act bound to an id not on screen is dropped;
   a digit in `say.values` refuses the say (falls back to `notYet`).
4. **Session** (`engine/session.ts`, wrapped by `useOneSession.ts`) — a reply's screen ops
   are pending for 450 ms (the "opening the views" line), then applied as steps. ≤ 3 views;
   a 4th replaces the oldest **unpinned** one in its slot and says which; showing a view
   already on screen focuses it. Pins ≤ 2. Every step records the arrangement first, sets a
   one-line `lastChange`, and `undo()` restores the arrangement before the last step
   (screen changes only, never data acts). The user's hand on a panel (pin, close, focus,
   show) drops pending ops and the change line says so. `stop()` drops pending ops and
   restores the screen from before the turn. Proposals land with the turn (an offer is not
   a rearrangement) and `navigate` is drawn as a Console link on the turn — the conductor
   never moves the user off `/one` by itself.

## Panels (module views)

Each panel reads an EXISTING GET route through `panels/read.ts` (keeps the error body's
`code`; an unrecognised body is an error, never "empty"; two panels on the same URL share
one request; `epoch` re-reads after a data act). Every panel renders in a kit `Section`
(loading = the quiet line, no skeleton; error = critical note with Retry, text from
`useErrorMessage()`), states a real empty sentence, and offers "Open in Console" via
`buildUrl` / `clearedTabScopedParams` (`app/features/shell/tabs.ts`). A count the read did
not return is "—" with its reason, never 0. Layout hooks: `look` → `data-look`,
`className` on the panel root.

| Kind | Reads | Shows | Empty / error | Console |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| needs | `/api/attention` | one row per bucket (+ Candi's open proposals), numeral, press opens the view | "Nothing is waiting on you." / coded | each bucket's tab |
| pipelineSlice | `/api/pipeline` | active entries; `role` (title/id match), `filter` aging (same tier as the badge, `agingTierAt`) or new (axis `entry` role); ≤ 8 + "first N of M" | per-filter sentence / coded | `pipeline` (+`role`, row: `q=<label>`) |
| decisionsQueue | `/api/pipeline` (what `useDecisionsQueue` reads) | active entries on a human gate (`needsHumanDecision`); Advance / Reject → hand proposal | "No candidate is waiting…" / coded | `decisions` |
| scheduleAhead | `/api/schedule?limit=200` | confirmed invites with a future slot, soonest first, in the server's `interviewTz`; says when the read was `truncated` | "No interviews…" / coded | `schedule` |
| funnel | `/api/analytics?days=30` | reached + conversion per stage; the entry stage's conversion is a dash with its reason | "No candidates entered…" / coded | `analytics` |
| jobDrafts | `/api/jobs/status` | draft roles | "No draft roles…" / generic (that route has no coded failure) | `jobs` (+`job`) |
| outbox | `/api/comms?limit=8` | newest messages with `commsVerdict`; a caution note when no relay is configured | "Nothing has been sent…" / coded | `channels` |
| roleCard | `/api/jobs?q=<role>&limit=1` | company, location, seniority, lifecycle, hired / target; "N more match" | "Name a role…" / "No role matches…" / coded | `jobs` (+`job`), its pipeline (`role=<id>`) |

## Acts and their doors (`consent/`)

The ConsentCard renders from the **resolved** act (`consent/acts.ts`), never from reply text:
title, consequence, what reaches the candidate's inbox, any cost, and whether an undo
exists. One primary (coral) button per card; "Not now" dismisses. Rendering runs nothing.

| Act | Door (no new route) | Emails | After |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| entryAdvance / entryReject | `POST /api/pipeline/[id]` `{action: "accept"/"reject", expectedStage}` | reject: the rejection letter; advance: may send the next step's invitation | result line; final (no undo from here). `PIPELINE_STAGE_CHANGED` / `PIPELINE_MOVE_CONFLICT` / not-found → "this moved — refresh" |
| wave | `POST /api/pipeline/command` `{text}` preview (rows + total), then `{text, confirm: true, confirmIds}` | reject: each a letter; advance: may invite | counts from the response; reject wave → Undo via `POST /api/pipeline/command/reverse` `{ids, text}` (≤ 200 ids, else "reverse from the Console"); advance is final |
| companion | **downgraded** to a Console hand-off (`run_analysis` → analyze, `draft_jd` → intake, `draft_outreach` / `generate_digest` → pipeline, where the candidate drawer and Candi's dock live) | — | the card states the model-call cost and why it cannot start here |

The wave's text is built so the existing parser (`app/_lib/pipeline-command.ts`) reads it
back to the same intent (pinned by `consent/acts.test.ts`).

## Known gaps

- **Companion acts cannot run from `/one`.** A companion proposal is only ever created
  inside a model turn of a Candi thread (`createProposal` in `app/_lib/db/companion.ts` has
  no caller outside that module; `/api/companion/**` exposes threads, messages, brain and
  resolve — no create). Round 1 adds no route, so the card hands off to the Console.
- **Single-entry acts have no undo here.** `reinstate` reverses only an auto-rejection;
  a hand reject is reopened through the Console's re-add door.
- **The conductor is keyword-matched**, English-only on the input side; the replies are
  catalogued. `cs` / `de` / `fr` carry the English `one.core` strings until promotion.
- **The greeting is the first beat only**; it does not re-read after a data act (panels do).
- **Undo of a reply is per step** (the last screen change), not "undo the whole reply".
