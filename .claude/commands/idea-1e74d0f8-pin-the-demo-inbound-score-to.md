## REQUIREMENT

# Pin the demo inbound score to the screen threshold

## Metadata
- **Category**: maintenance
- **Effort**: Medium (2/3)

## Description
The inbound demo applicant is given a deterministic score of 62 + (id.charCodeAt % 10), i.e. 62-71, in /api/sim/inbound so it survives screening, while the screen step hardcodes override { rejectBottomPercent: 25, maxMatchToReject: 60 } inline in SimulationProvider. These numbers are coupled: raise the reject ceiling above 71 and the scripted applicant gets auto-rejected mid-demo, yet they live in different files with no link. Extract the screen-wave override into a named constant in constants.ts and add a comment/invariant that the inbound score floor must exceed the reject ceiling.

## Reasoning
The demos headline promise (follow this candidate to Hired) silently depends on a magic-number relationship no one documented. Surfacing the coupling in one place prevents a future threshold tweak from breaking the demo in a baffling way and makes the screening thresholds reviewable instead of buried in a request body.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Demo Simulation & Channels

**Description**: An interactive scripted demo that simulates the whole recruiting flow (inbound applications, screening, decision waves, group eval, offers) with spotlight UI and reset controls, plus the Channels inbox aggregating inbound candidate comms.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
