## REQUIREMENT

# Stop leaking raw error messages from analyses APIs

## Metadata
- **Category**: code_quality
- **Effort**: Medium (2/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (4/3)
- **Scan Type**: bug_hunter
- **Generated**: 6/2/2026, 4:23:02 PM

## Description
Both /api/analyses and /api/analyses/[slug] return error.message verbatim in the 500 JSON body, which can expose the SQLite file path and engine internals to any client. Log the full error server-side and return a generic, stable message to the caller (e.g. 'Failed to load analyses.'), matching how the rest of the app surfaces errors.

## Reasoning
Leaking filesystem paths and DB internals to clients is a low-effort information-disclosure foothold and adds noise to client error states. A generic message plus server-side logging is the standard, safe pattern.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Analysis Results & Reporting

**Description**: Renders the multi-tab candidate report — job-fit, salary, interview, extraction and compare — with score dials, factor charts and AI disclosures, and persists/reopens past analyses from history.
**Related Files**:
- `app/_components/results/ResultPanel.tsx`
- `app/_components/results/shared.tsx`
- `app/_components/results/job-fit/JobFitTab.tsx`
- `app/_components/results/job-fit/MissingSkillsTiers.tsx`

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
