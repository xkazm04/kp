## REQUIREMENT

# Extract a shared SectionCard panel shell

## Metadata
- **Category**: maintenance
- **Effort**: Unknown (4/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (5/3)
- **Scan Type**: code_refactor

## Description
The wrapper 'rounded-lg border border-stone-200 bg-white p-5 shadow-panel', usually paired with a 'flex items-center gap-2' header and a 'font-serif text-h3 text-ink' title plus an optional lucide icon, repeats 15+ times across ExtractionTab, JobFitTab, SalaryTab, CompareTab, InterviewTab and the history detail header. Extract a <SectionCard title icon> component (plus a bare <Panel> for the title-less cases) so the card chrome and title typography are declared once.

## Reasoning
This presentational boilerplate is the single most-repeated markup in the results context; centralizing it shrinks every tab, prevents class drift between panels, and turns a future restyle into a one-file change. It is a pure markup extraction, so behavior is preserved.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Analysis Results & Reporting

**Description**: Renders the multi-tab candidate report — job-fit, salary, interview, extraction and compare — with score dials, factor charts and AI disclosures, and persists/reopens past analyses from history.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
