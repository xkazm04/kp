## REQUIREMENT

# Centralize the +30% salary growth-target rule

## Metadata
- **Category**: maintenance
- **Effort**: Low (1/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (4/3)

## Description
The salary growth target is computed as midpoint * 1.3 in two places — SalaryGauge.tsx (line 22) and SalaryTab.tsx (line 12, which additionally rounds to the nearest 5000) — with the '+30%' label hardcoded beside each. Move the multiplier, the 5000-rounding, and the label into a single salaryGrowthTarget(midpoint) helper in format.ts that returns { value, label }, so the gauge's dashed marker and the callout card both read from one rule.

## Reasoning
A business constant duplicated across a chart and its caption will eventually drift — change the multiplier in one and the gauge marker silently disagrees with the headline number. Unifying it is roughly an hour of work that removes a whole class of 'why don't these match?' bugs.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Analysis Results & Reporting

**Description**: Renders the multi-tab candidate report — job-fit, salary, interview, extraction and compare — with score dials, factor charts and AI disclosures, and persists/reopens past analyses from history.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
