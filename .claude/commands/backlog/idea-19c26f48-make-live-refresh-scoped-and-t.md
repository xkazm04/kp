## REQUIREMENT

# Make live-refresh scoped and typed, not all-or-nothing

## Metadata
- **Category**: maintenance
- **Effort**: High (3/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (5/3)
- **Scan Type**: zen_architect

## Description
live-refresh.ts fires one bare kp:data-changed event, so a mutation in the simulation driver forces every open subscriber � Analytics, Matrix, Pipeline � to refetch regardless of relevance. Give notifyDataChanged and useLiveRefresh an optional typed scope (e.g. a union of "pipeline" | "jobs" | "profiles"); subscribers only reload when their scope (or a wildcard) is signalled. Keep the debounce and latest-handler ref intact; the change is purely adding a scope filter to the existing bus.

## Reasoning
Today an unrelated mutation triggers redundant network and render work across tabs the user is not even mutating, which scales worse as tabs grow. A typed scope turns a blunt broadcast into precise invalidation, cutting wasted fetches while making the refresh contract self-documenting and type-checked at every call site.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Workspace Shell & Shared UI

**Description**: The studio shell that hosts every feature tab — workspace layout, sidebar navigation, tab routing, live-refresh, root layout/metadata and the shared UI primitives (badges, modal, markdown, icons) reused across features.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
