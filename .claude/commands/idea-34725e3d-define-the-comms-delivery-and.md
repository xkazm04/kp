## REQUIREMENT

# Define the comms delivery and recipient contract

## Metadata
- **Category**: functionality
- **Effort**: High (3/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (6/3)

## Description
comms.ts records local messages with status queued but nothing ever dequeues, delivers, or retries them, and WebhookChannel records failed on a bad response with no retry or alert; meanwhile candidateRecipient in comms-dispatch.ts resolves to a human label, or the literal string candidate, because the data model stores no email. Document and decide the contract: is queued a terminal dev state or a real pending one, should webhook failures retry or dead-letter, and what identifier does a relay actually receive as the recipient. Capture the answer in code comments plus a short doc and a status enum.

## Reasoning
In a recruiting product a silently-dropped offer or rejection is a serious, candidate-facing failure, yet the current outbox makes queued and failed look benign and never escalates. Pinning down the delivery semantics and recipient resolution prevents real outreach from quietly vanishing once a webhook relay is wired up.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Demo Simulation & Channels

**Description**: An interactive scripted demo that simulates the whole recruiting flow (inbound applications, screening, decision waves, group eval, offers) with spotlight UI and reset controls, plus the Channels inbox aggregating inbound candidate comms.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
